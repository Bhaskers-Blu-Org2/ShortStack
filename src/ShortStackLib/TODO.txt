        [ ] Include only the appropriate PRs in the finish description
    [ ] SS:  When finishing a stack auto-add all of the participats in the individual code reviews

    [ ] SS: Be smart about when to push a new level or update an existing one.  Maybe if the files are similar.

            [ ] If fresh PR,
                [ ] first line of commits is title
                    all the rest is the description

    [ ] How to get shortstack to work when I don't have createbranch permissions? (E.g: OS Branch)

    [ ] Error in script
        The readme says to run Import-Module c:\tools\shortstack\ShortStack.psm1 -Force
        It should say Import-Module c:\tools\shortstack\scripts\ShortStack.psm1 -Force
	[ ] pull down a stack from the server and mess with it locally
        - Need to be able to resolve when branch N on the server is ahead of local N branch
