	[x] Convert to .net core
    [ ] Look at Posh-SSH  https://github.com/darkoperator/Posh-SSHstar

    [ ] New-Stack MyTest should create a new stack branch
        [ ] Works on both ssh and regular
    [ ] Get-Stacks should show whatever stacks exist
    [ ] Get-StackStaus should show very basic status
    [ ] Push-StackLevel should create a PR 
    [ ] Get-StackStatus should show the different levels
    [ ] Select-stacklevel should move between stack levels
    [ ] Update-Stack should push through changes
        - User rebase instead of merge?


NEW
    [ ] Problem: native dlls must be copied locally to library.dll to work
    [ ] Problem: Doesn't work right off the bat with ssh
    [ ] Stories:
        - An external person pushes a PR into some level of the stack
        - Squashnig a stack mid-run
        - picking up from a completed stack
        - Quick stack for simple changes
    
	
NEXT

SOON
    [ ] Fix the SS script
        [ ] Dont finish if PR's aren't completed.
        [ ] Include only the appropriate PRs in the finish description
    [ ] SS:  When finishing a stack auto-add all of the participats in the individual code reviews

    [ ] SS: Be smart about when to push a new level or update an existing one.  Maybe if the files are similar.
    [ ] SS Bug: Finish puts incorrect material in the final description

    
    [ ] SS: Quick command to pick up a new stack starting from master
    [ ] SS: Script Bug: links in the finish request have extra long names
    [ ] SS: Experiment with rebasing

        [ ] SS: push-stack
            [x] Complain if not stacked
            [x] Complain if there are no changes
            [?] If Something has been pushed, require the -force parameter to include the change
            [ ] If fresh PR,
                [ ] first line of commits is title
                    all the rest is the description
                [ ] push changes
                [ ] generate PR
            [ ] If old PR, add new commit descriptions to PR drscription
            [ ] Sanity check: there should only be at most one PR
            [ ] Wrap dangling changes into a commit or bail
                - Enter commit comment or press ESC
        [ ] Push-stack
            - auto checkin if there are no commits
	
	[ ] Sharing a stack with others
		Import-Stack


		[ ] Bug: Fails on a brand new empty branch
    [ ] Bug: Fails when the branch is not tracking something on the server

    [ ] How to get shortstack to work when I don't have createbranch permissions? (E.g: OS Branch)

    [ ] Error in script
        The readme says to run Import-Module c:\tools\shortstack\ShortStack.psm1 -Force
        It should say Import-Module c:\tools\shortstack\scripts\ShortStack.psm1 -Force
	[ ] pull down a stack from the server and mess with it locally
        - Need to be able to resolve when branch N on the server is ahead of local N branch
